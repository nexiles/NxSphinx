Notes
=====

Here We'll list the *customer requirements* identified so far.

.. warning:: This list is not ordered in a particular way, the numbers no *not*
          indicate priority or anything similar.  They're just reference numbers.

.. note:: We'll try to use the phrases `MUST`, `MAY`, ... as specified in
          `RFC2119`_.  Please have a look.

List of Requirements
====================

**R001 Documentation MUST Be Accessible For All Nexiles Staff**
    We need to make docs accessible by every nexiles employee.

**R002 Documentation MUST Be In The Code Repository**
    The docs MUST be included in the git reposiotory.

**R003 Documentation MUST Contain Mandatory Pages**
    All documentation MUST contain all the mandatory pages listed in this
    document.

**R004 Documentation SHOULD Be Public Accessible If Allowed**
    When doing FOSS projects, we SHOULD make the documentation public.

**R005 Documentation MUST use The Nexiles Theme**
    All docs MUST use the nexiles theme.

**R006 Documentation MUST Be The Single Source Of Truth**
    We MUST NOT have any secondary documentation not listed, and
    requirements not listed.  If it's not documented, then it's not
    there.

**R007 Documentation SHOULD Include References**
    We do not want to restate/copy stuff -- when we use other tools and /
    or documentation, then we'll add a *reference* to **that**
    documentation.
