Intro
=====

A paragraph containing only two colons 
indicates that the following indented 
or quoted text is a literal block. 

:: 

  Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and 
  all kinds of markup (like *this* or 
  \this) is preserved by literal blocks. 

  The paragraph containing only '::' 
  will be omitted from the result. 

The ``::`` may be tacked onto the very 
end of any paragraph. The ``::`` will be 
omitted if it is preceded by whitespace. 
The ``::`` will be converted to a single 
colon if preceded by text, like this:: 

  It's very convenient to use this form. 

Literal blocks end when text returns to 
the preceding paragraph's indentation. 
This means that something like this 
is possible:: 

      We start here 
    and continue here 
  and end here. 

Per-line quoting can also be used on 
unindented literal blocks::
